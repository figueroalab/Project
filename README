DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File list (filenames, directory structure (for zipped files) and brief description of all data files):

Dataset Name: Phenotypes

Description: I gathered phenotypes for several fungal isolates (column headings) based on the reactions of plants with specific disease resistance (rows). Currently blank cells indicate lack of information. A = lack of disease (avirulence), V= virulence disease. Dataset will be found in the data folder under Project

Dataset Name: Deletions_Pgt21

Description: Coverage per base of gene was determined and provided by a private collaborator. The percentage of coverage per gene was then calculated.Dataset will be found in the data folder under Project


Relationship between files, if important for context:  

Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: N/A

If data was derived from another source, list source: List publication by XXX

If there are there multiple versions of the dataset, list the file updated, when and why update was made: N/A
